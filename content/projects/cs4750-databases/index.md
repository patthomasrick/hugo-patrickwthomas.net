Hoo's Watching is a website based around movies and is similar to the functions that IMDb's website provides. Users of the website can make an account, like and comment on movies, add a movie to their favorites or watch list, add friends and see what their friends are following, and also like and rate principles and actors of titles.

This was a semester-long project in collaboration with three other UVa students (Jessica Heavner, Julian Cornejo Castro, and Solimar Kwa). Simply put, we were tasked with making a dynamic, fully-functional website or standalone application that interfaced with a database.
